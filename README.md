# beingtomgreen.jellyfin_docker

A simple ansible role for running [Jellyfin](https://www.jellyfin.org/) via Docker compose using the [LinuxServer.io Jellyfin image](https://docs.linuxserver.io/images/docker-jellyfin).

For additional information on how to best handle your media paths see information on [wiki.servarr.com](https://wiki.servarr.com/docker-guide#consistent-and-well-planned-paths) and [trash-guides.info](https://trash-guides.info/File-and-Folder-Structure/Hardlinks-and-Instant-Moves/).

## Installation

Given that Galaxy seems to have abandoned roles, I suggest referencing this repository directly in your projects `requirements.yml`:

```yaml
---

roles:
  - name: beingtomgreen.jellyfin_docker
    src: https://github.com/BeingTomGreen/ansible-role-jellyfin-docker.git

collections: []
```

You can then install it alongside your other requirements as normal:

```bash
ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml
```

## Example usage

### Basic usage

```yaml
---

- hosts: jellyfin
  become: true
  vars:
    # The environment attribute defines environment variables set in the container.
    jellyfin_docker_environment:
      PUID: 1000
      PGID: 1000
      TZ: 'Etc/UTC'

    # Specifies the image to start the container from.
    jellyfin_docker_image: "lscr.io/linuxserver/jellyfin:latest"

    # Defines the policy that the platform applies on container termination.
    jellyfin_docker_restart_policy: 'unless-stopped'

    # The volumes attribute define mount host paths or named volumes that are accessible by service containers.
    jellyfin_docker_volumes:
        - '/path/to/tv:/tv'
        - '/path/to/movies:/movies'
        - '/path/to/music:/music'
  roles:
    - role: beingtomgreen.jellyfin_docker
```

### Hardware Acceleration

Jellyfin supports hardware acceleration with a GPU, but will require [additional config](https://docs.linuxserver.io/images/docker-jellyfin/#hardware-acceleration), you should also look over the [Hardware Acceleration Enhancements](https://docs.linuxserver.io/images/docker-jellyfin/#hardware-acceleration-enhancements).

#### AMD

If you're rocking an AMD card, setup is nice and simple, as you'd expect:

```yaml
---

- hosts: jellyfin
  become: true
  vars:
    # Pass through your devices
    jellyfin_docker_devices:
      - '/dev/dri:/dev/dri'
      - '/dev/kfd:/dev/kfd'

    # Add the AMD mod
    jellyfin_docker_environment:
      PUID: 1000
      PGID: 1000
      TZ: 'Etc/UTC'
      DOCKER_MODS: 'linuxserver/mods:jellyfin-amd'

  roles:
    - role: beingtomgreen.jellyfin_docker
```

#### Intel

If you're rocking an Intel card, setup is also nice and simple:

```yaml
---

- hosts: jellyfin
  become: true
  vars:
    # Pass through your device
    jellyfin_docker_devices:
      - '/dev/dri:/dev/dri'

    # Add the Intel mod
    jellyfin_docker_environment:
      PUID: 1000
      PGID: 1000
      TZ: 'Etc/UTC'
      DOCKER_MODS: 'linuxserver/mods:jellyfin-opencl-intel'

  roles:
    - role: beingtomgreen.jellyfin_docker
```

#### NVIDIA

If you're stuck with an NVIDIA GPU, you will need the [container toolkit](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-container-toolkit) installed, and then set the `runtime` to `nvidia`:

```yaml
---

- hosts: jellyfin
  become: true
  vars:
    # Use the Nvidia container toolkit's runtime
    jellyfin_docker_runtime: 'nvidia'

    # Optionally, set a comma separated list of device UUIDs or index(es)
    jellyfin_docker_environment:
      PUID: 1000
      PGID: 1000
      TZ: 'Etc/UTC'
      NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES: '2,3'

  roles:
    - role: beingtomgreen.jellyfin_docker
```

#### ARM Devices

In most cases if `/dev/dri` exists on the host, it should just work:

```yaml
---

- hosts: jellyfin
  become: true
  vars:
    jellyfin_docker_devices:
      - '/dev/dri:/dev/dri'
  roles:
    - role: beingtomgreen.jellyfin_docker
```

If you're running a Raspberry Pi 4, be sure to enable `dtoverlay=vc4-fkms-v3d` in your `usercfg.txt`, and [check out the docs](https://docs.linuxserver.io/images/docker-jellyfin/#openmax-raspberry-pi).

### Want the kitchen sink?

Seriously, take a look at [`defaults/main.yml`](defaults/main.yml), it's obnoxiously commented, just for you.

```yaml
---

- hosts: jellyfin
  become: true
  vars:
  vars:
    # User that will own the compose files
    jellyfin_docker_user: "{{ ansible_user }}"

    # Base path for deployment
    jellyfin_docker_base_directory: '/opt/jellyfin_docker'

    # Define the number of (potentially virtual) CPUs to allocate to service containers. This is a fractional number. 0.000 means no limit.
    jellyfin_docker_cpus: 1.5

    # A string that specifies a custom container name, rather than a name generated by default.
    # Follows the regex format of [a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9_.-]+
    jellyfin_docker_container_name: 'jellyfin'

    # Defines custom DNS servers to set on the container network interface configuration. It can be a single value or a list.
    jellyfin_docker_dns:
      - 8.8.8.8
      - 9.9.9.9

    # The environment attribute defines environment variables set in the container.
    jellyfin_docker_environment:
      PUID: 1000
      PGID: 1000
      TZ: 'Etc/UTC'

    # Specifies the image to start the container from.
    jellyfin_docker_image: "lscr.io/linuxserver/jellyfin:latest"

    # Configures a limit on the amount of memory a container can allocate, set as a string expressing a byte value.
    jellyfin_docker_mem_limit: '250mb'

    # Defines the policy that the platform applies on container termination.
    jellyfin_docker_restart_policy: 'unless-stopped'

    jellyfin_docker_volumes:
      - '/path/to/tv:/tv'
      - '/path/to/movies:/movies'
      - '/path/to/music:/music'

    jellyfin_docker_base_directory: '/opt/jellyfin_docker'

  roles:
    - role: beingtomgreen.jellyfin_docker
```
